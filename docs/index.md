RNM is a cross-platform file renaming tool focused on speed, safety, and user-control. It allows files and directories to be renamed using consistent casing rules and structured rename operations.

RNM is primarily a command-line tool and is planned to be available with a GUI that mirrors the CLI functionality.

---

## Key Features (CLI)

- Rename files using casing formats such as kebab-case, snake_case, Title Case, camelCase, and PascalCase.
- Apply rename operations recursively across directory trees.
- Optionally include directories or target directories only during rename operations.
- Preview changes using dry run before applying them.
- Record local history for rename operations to support undo (unless history is skipped for an operation).

---

## Graphical Interface (Planned)

- A minimalist GUI that exposes the same functionality as the CLI.
- Intended to support future advanced features such as template-based renaming.
- Planned integration with the Windows context menu.
