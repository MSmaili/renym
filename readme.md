# rnm — Fast, Safe, Cross-Platform File Rename Tool

**rnm** is a high-performance, extensible, cross-platform command-line tool for batch renaming files and directories.
It provides a clean architecture, safe rename planning, and a powerful rename _expression language_ that supports metadata, counters, formatting functions, and optional regex captures.

## Why this tool?

This tool mainly is created for my brother. He needed a tool to rename, and silly me said it is easy to create, so here we are.
